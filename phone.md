## ME360 Phone Attachment Sketching

This was the first project for the course. The main goal of this assignment was to get a sense of doing engneering sketches, deciding ideas between the team, and 3D Print our sketched concepts. The idea our team decided to sketch was a phone speaker amplifier attachment. The attachment would go on the bottom of the phone, and have a little passageway to amplify sound coming from the speaker.

Below are some initial sketches, as well as a modified design. Initially, we printed the horn piece without any other support but its own walls. This failed as the part was a bit too thin. We then changed the design to fully contain the horn inside a block, making it a lot more stable.
