## ME360 2.5 DOF System

For our final project, we were tasked with designing a 2.5 Degree of Freedom System to accomplish a task. This means the device was able to move in X and Y directions, and a half degree of freedom as the form of an actuator to trigger off or on. We initially opted to design a cookie decorating machine, but towards the development of the pump it proved close to impossible to pump icing as it was too airy to pump through. Our final design consisted of a machine that pumped your desired drink into any array of cups within the build plate.

My main duties I did on this project include the design of the initial idea, substantial work on the Y-axis linear drive system (including Solidworks assemblies and modelling), part manufacturing and tolerancing, as well as programming the system GCode.
