## ME360 Open Loop Control

For this assignment, we were tasked with developing a cart to balance an 8020 Aluminum bar. The main goal of the project was to use open loop control (control the system with no feedback) to balance an Aluminum bar on a platform, in order to bring it 10 feet accross, without having it fall.

Designing this system was a challenging process. As part of the design process, each of us developed a Solidworks Motion Simulation to test our control approach. The complicated part with the motion analysis was getting all the mates correctly so the bar wouldn't teleport through the platform and it would simulate the real world as much as possible. Out of our simulations, we got a time value of under 20 seconds to transport the bar 10 feet accross using a triangle shaped acceleration graph.

When it came to design the physical cart, we opted for a 4 wheel design along with axles and gears to translate the motion of the stepper to the wheels. I worked substantially in the sketching phase, as well as manufacturing the parts to the correct tolerances to assemble our cart.
