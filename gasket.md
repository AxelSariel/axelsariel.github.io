## ME360 Gasket Project

The first project in the course consisted of precisely measuring a gasket block and manufacturing a gasket for it. The material used for the gasket was thin HDPE sheets. They were machined using a CNC mill at EPIC. I measured the gasket block using calipers, sketched out all the dimensions and made a model in Solidworks. I then took the Solidworks model and generated machining paths for the mill using GibbsCAM. I loaded the GibbsCAM exported GCode onto the CNC mill, loaded the stock material in with some double sided adhesive, and hit cycle start. The entire process of cutting out the gasket took less than a minute.

My gasket fit mostly fine overall; you can see in the pictures there was one vertical dimension around the square holes that was a bit off. This may have been due to some measurement error in that dimension; in the future I will make sure all the dimensions add up correctly and I'm not missing any dimensions before doing my Solidworks sketch. Below are some images of the process.
