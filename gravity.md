## ME360 Gravity Calculation

For this assignment, we focused on reading fast electrical signals with an Arduino. We were tasked with calculating the acceleration value of gravity using an Arduino, aluminum foil, a golf ball, wires, and tape. We set up the circuit in a way that the ball acted like a button in a sense. We had a aluminum contact points connected via wires from the Arduino to both the edge of the table, as well as the floor. The ball also had aluminum foil around it and a wire going to the Arduino. As the ball stopped making contact with the table as it was being dropped, the Arduino started counting the milliseconds the ball spent in the air. When the ball touched the floor, the Arduino stopped counting and used the time value, along with the height of the table, to calculate the gravity acceleration value.

We performed various trials and our best value we got was 9.82, pretty close to the actual value of gravity. Below are some pictures of the circuit and other calculations.
